# Machine Learning

* **SUPERVISED**
  * **Objectives**
    * Predict the behavior of the phenomenon in new cases (test data).
    * Study the relationship between explanatory variables and the answer.
    * Check the quality of predictions.

  * **LINEAR REGRESSION**
  
    * **Short explanation**: Linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent   variables)
  
    * **Applications**: Analyze the marketing effectiveness, pricing and promotions on sales of a product, assess risk in financial services or insurance domain, project the sale of a product according to the price, trend lines, etc..
    
    * **Example**: [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://pages.github.com/): A machine learning model to predict the value of a particular home in the Boston real estate market.

  * **LOGISTIC REGRESSION**
  
    * **Short explanation**: Logistic Regression is a mathematical model used in statistics to estimate (guess) the probability of an event occurring using some previous data. Logistic Regression works with binary data, where either the event happens (1) or the event does not happen (0).
    
    * **Applications**: Fraud detection ,Email spam or ham, Sentiment Analysis, Image segmentation, recognition and classification, Object detection, Handwriting recognition, Disease (diabetes, cancer etc.) prediction
    
    * **Example**: [Heart Disease Prediction](https://pages.github.com/): World Health Organization has estimated that four out of five cardiovascular diseases(CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks. This whole research intends to pinpoint the ratio of patients who possess a good chance of being affected by CVD and also to predict the overall risk using Logistic Regression.

      
* **UNSUPERVISED**
  * **Objectives**
    * There is no answer variable. Explanatory variables only.
    * Objectives are more diverse: to find concepts that are more find explanatory variables that behave in a similar way, etc.
       
   * **K-MEANS CLUSTER**
  
     * **Short explanation**: Process of division of the dataset into groups in which the members in the same group possess similarities in features. 
    
     * **Applications**: Document classification, delivery store optimization, identifying crime localities, customer segmentation, fantasy league stat analysis, insurance fraud detection, rideshare data analysis, cyber-profiling criminals, call record detail analysis, automatic clustering of it alerts
    
     * **Example**: [Clustering stocks](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Clustering%20stocks.ipynb): Calculating your historical returns and volatility and then proceed to use the K-Means clustering algorithm to divide stocks into separate groups based on those returns and volatilities.

   
   * **TIME SERIES**
  
     * **Short explanation**: Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.
    
     * **Applications**: Changes in stock prices on the Stock Exchange, Size of the population of a city, state or country, Quarterly sales of a store, Electricity consumption, Passenger demand of an airline throughout the year.
    
     * **Example**: [Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Forecasting.ipynb): Predict CO2 based on data called "atmospheric CO2 from continuous air samples at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, USA", which collected CO2 samples from March 1958 to December 2001.
