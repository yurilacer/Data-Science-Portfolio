# Machine Learning

* **SUPERVISED**
  * **Objectives**
    * Predict the behavior of the phenomenon in new cases (test data).
    * Study the relationship between explanatory variables and the answer.
    * Check the quality of predictions.

  * **LINEAR REGRESSION**
  
    * **Short explanation**: Linear approach to modelling the relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent   variables)
  
    * **Applications**: Analyze the marketing effectiveness, pricing and promotions on sales of a product, assess risk in financial services or insurance domain, project the sale of a product according to the price, trend lines, etc..
    
    * **Example**: [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Boston%20Housing%20Prices.ipynb): A machine learning model to predict the value of a particular home in the Boston real estate market.
	
	* **Example**: [Customer Lifetime Value](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Lifetime%20Value.ipynb): The idea of this project is to calculate customers' CLTV and develop a machine learning model to predict CLTV for new customers.
The model used in this project was linear regression.

  * **LOGISTIC REGRESSION**
  
    * **Short explanation**: Logistic Regression is a mathematical model used in statistics to estimate (guess) the probability of an event occurring using some previous data. Logistic Regression works with binary data, where either the event happens (1) or the event does not happen (0).
    
    * **Applications**: Fraud detection ,Email spam or ham, Sentiment Analysis, Image segmentation, recognition and classification, Object detection, Handwriting recognition, Disease (diabetes, cancer etc.) prediction
    
    * **Example**: [Heart Disease Prediction](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Heart%20Disease%20Prediction.ipynb): World Health Organization has estimated that four out of five cardiovascular diseases(CVD) deaths are due to heart attacks. This whole research intends to pinpoint the ratio of patients who possess a good chance of being affected by CVD and also to predict the overall risk using Logistic Regression.

  * **DECISION TREE**
  
    * **Short explanation**: A decision tree is basically a binary tree flowchart where each node splits a group of observations according to some feature variable. The goal of a decision tree is to split your data into groups such that every element in one group belongs to the same category.
    
    * **Applications**: Assessing prospective growth opportunities, Using demographic data to find prospective clients, Business Management, Customer Relationship Management, Fraudulent Statement Detection, Energy Consumption, Fault Diagnosis, Healthcare Management, Face Recognition, Medical Image Classification.
    
    * **Example**: [Drugs Prediction](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Drugs%20Prediction.ipynb): The idea of this project is to build a model to discover an ideal drug for a new patient, based on a data set with information from patients with the same disease, in which each patient responded to one of the five drugs.


  * **SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE**
    
    * **Short explanation**: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for both classification and regression problems. SVM performs very well with even a limited amount of data.
    
    * **Applications**: Image Recognition, Text Category Assignment, Spam Detection, Sentiment Analysis, Gene Expression Classification, Regression, Outlier Detection, Clustering
    	  
    * **Example**: [Cancer Prediction](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/SVM%20Cancer.ipynb): The idea of this project is to build a model to discover an ideal drug for a new patient, based on a data set with information from patients with the same disease, in which each patient responded to one of the five drugs.		  	  
	  
  * **NAIVE BAYES**
    
    * **Short explanation**: Naive Bayes is among one of the simplest, but most powerful algorithms for classification based on Bayes Theorem with an assumption of independence among predictors.
    
    * **Applications**: Spam filtering, Text classification, Sentiment analysis, Recommender system
    	  
    * **Example**: [Wine Classifier](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Naive%20Bayes%20Classifier.ipynb): The idea of this project is to create a classifier for wines, using as a database the information chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy.

	  
* **UNSUPERVISED**
  * **Objectives**
    * There is no answer variable. Explanatory variables only.
    * Objectives are more diverse: to find concepts that are more find explanatory variables that behave in a similar way, etc.
       
   * **K-MEANS CLUSTER**
  
     * **Short explanation**: Process of division of the dataset into groups in which the members in the same group possess similarities in features. 
    
     * **Applications**: Document classification, delivery store optimization, identifying crime localities, customer segmentation, fantasy league stat analysis, insurance fraud detection, rideshare data analysis, cyber-profiling criminals, call record detail analysis, automatic clustering of it alerts
    
     * **Example**: [Clustering stocks](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Clustering%20stocks.ipynb): Calculating your historical returns and volatility and then proceed to use the K-Means clustering algorithm to divide stocks into separate groups based on those returns and volatilities.

   
   * **TIME SERIES**
  
     * **Short explanation**: Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.
    
     * **Applications**: Changes in stock prices on the Stock Exchange, Size of the population of a city, state or country, Quarterly sales of a store, Electricity consumption, Passenger demand of an airline throughout the year.
    
     * **Example**: [Time Series Forecasting](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Time%20Series%20Forecasting.ipynb): Predict CO2 based on data called "atmospheric CO2 from continuous air samples at the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, USA", which collected CO2 samples from March 1958 to December 2001.    

   * **MARKET BASKET**
  
     * **Short explanation**: Market Basket Analysis is a analysis technique which identifies the strength of association between pairs of products purchased together and identify patterns of co-occurrence.
    
     * **Applications**: Cross Selling, Product Placement, Affinity Promotion, Fraud Detection, Customer Behavior
    
     * **Example**: [Market Basket](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Market%20Basket.ipynb): The aim of the project is to make an analysis of the purchase data from Germany and France from the data set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository that represents transactional data from a UK retailer from 2010-2011.

   * **PCA**
  
     * **Short explanation**: Principal component analysis, or PCA, is a statistical technique to convert high dimensional data to low dimensional data by selecting the most important features that capture maximum information about the dataset
    
     * **Applications**: Image compression, Customer profiling, Quantitative Finance, Facial Recognition, Other applications like Medical Data correlation, Neuroscience
    
     * **Example**: [PCA](https://github.com/yurilacer/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/PCA.ipynb) : The idea of this project is to apply the dimensionality reduction technique - PCA and train a model using the reduced set of main components.
